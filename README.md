# FullStack-Project
Website for finding movies and series. You can register an account for the website (only if you have the local database)
and login to the account to access your "Watch Later" -list. By browsing the main page or searching for movies / series
you can now see a new button on the media you are looking for. Clicking on the new plus button you can add the media to
your own list. You can also check out information about the media by clicking the image of the chosen media. You will
also see the providers that are available (currently only shows the providers for Finland). Media can also be deleted from your 
list. You can also change your username, password and if you wish, also delete your account.
